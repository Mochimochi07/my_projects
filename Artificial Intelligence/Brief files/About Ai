Descartes discovered the dualism theory of mind and body.
The theory stated the opposition of concepts which human beings were made up of the body and the mind.
Its connections are linked within the person's thoughts, attitudes, behaviors and physical health.
question pops up where a mechanical body inhabited by a person's data with stored emotions would be called human?

The advancement of AI was our oldest dreams.
As machines become more advanced, our society will become systematic.
Rationally, people will feel less compassion for each other.
The problem rose when computers must have a need to learn on how to empathize with humans.

The films, novels and dramas about robots gave some emotions from the humans as such scenario may exist in the future.
As an example, the korean drama Are You Human? Where the female protagonist and the robot expressed love for each other.
Recommending dramas such as "I'm not a Robot", "My Holo Love", "My Absolute Boyfriend" and other dramas that features robotics to people would give them feels that would touch their hearts.
The concepts will remain in their minds as a reminder of their love for AI.
