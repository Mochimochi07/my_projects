MAJAD was literally made for networking and security purposes only.
It was readjusted by AJ to make it a base project for his technology.
Aj always dreamt of having cybernetic enhancements since he was young.
The idea of enhancement was from watching Cyborg in Teen Titans and from Raiden from Metal Gear Series. 
MAJAD's purpose was for keeping the security secure and protecting the data while guiding the user in many ways.
MAJAD's cybernetic development is still being drawn, shaped, and kept for future use.
More time and research are required for developing the AI.
